Hello and welcome to my homepage! In 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Beihang University. During my bachelor's studies, I had the privilege of serving as a research assistant at Peking University and the University of Montreal and receiving the prestigious Mitacs Award from Canada.

After my graduation, I joined SenseTime, a leading company in AI tech, where I spent a year as a CV Algorithm Researcher. My work primarily focused on Pose Estimation.

Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Sydney, under the guidance of Professor Chang Xu. My expected graduation year is 2027, and during this period, I am dedicating my efforts to explore the realms of AIGC, diffusion models, and NAS.
